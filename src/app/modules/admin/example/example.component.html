                <h1>Landing Module</h1>
                <p>
                    This can be the landing or the welcome page of your application.
                    If you have an SSR (Server Side Rendering) setup, or if you
                    don't need to have Search engine visibility and optimizations,
                    you can even use this page as your primary landing page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a separate "module", it has its own directory and
                    routing setup and also it's completely separated from the actual
                    application. This is also a simple example of a multiple
                    applications setup that uses the same codebase. You can have
                    different entry points and essentially have different
                    applications within the same codebase.
